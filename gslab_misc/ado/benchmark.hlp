Description
-----------
Simulates data and runs analyses that we might expect from a
computationally intensive Stata script. Logs output time as I/O, 
Paralleled, or Serial. Takes no options. 

I/O time includes data creation and manipulation.

Parallel time includes regress and probit - both of which are 
highly parallelizable commands that we use frequently.

Serial time includes areg and xtreg - both of which are 
relatively unparallelizable commands that we use frequently. 

Options for use with ^checkdta^
